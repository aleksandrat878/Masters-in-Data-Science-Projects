# - For most predictors, GDP growth appears evenly distributed across the variable range, 
# with no strong linear trend. This suggests that growth is not explained by simple bivariate
# linear relationships for these predictors.
# 
# - Net trade stands out: while most countries trade close to balance, a handful 
# have very large surpluses or deficits, creating extreme outliers. This skews the 
# distribution and explains why net trade does not show a strong linear relationship with GDP growth.‚Äù
# 
# - These patterns highlight the importance of multivariate modeling: even if predictors 
# individually show weak associations, they may collectively explain variance in GDP growth 
# once considered together.

# Q1: Linear Regression Prediction

# Model A: baseline regression without Net trade

  age_dependency + urban_pct +
  life_expectancy_female + tax_payments + population_growth

model_A <- lm(formula_A, data = model_df_linear, singular.ok = FALSE)


# Model B: regression with Net Trade 
formula_B <- gdp_growth ~ gdp_pc_ppp + unemployment_total +
  age_dependency + urban_pct +
  life_expectancy_female + tax_payments +
  net_trade + population_growth

model_B <- lm(formula_B, data = model_df_linear, singular.ok = FALSE)

## We ran a linear regression to see if there is significant correlation, and possibly
## causation if assumptions hold, between different aspects such as Net Trade in goods and services, 
## and a load of other variables plausibly linked with the health of an economy, such as 
## gdp per capita in PPP terms, measured in constant 2011 US dollar equivalents. unemployment,
## life expectancy, urban population rate, population growth, age dependency ratio and the 
## amount of tax payments. We included Net Trade, as Net Trade is one of the sources of GDP, so 
## higher Net Trade would be expected to have a positive influence on GDP growth. When 
## looking at the output of the regression, we see that none of the factors has a 
## significant correlation with GDP growth. This is also the case for Net Trade, so including
## Net Trade has not been helpful in predicting GDP growth. Also, the adjusted R-squared  
## decreased, so the model decreased in explanative capability. This is because the variation in
## Net Trade is too big for the estimated positive effect to be surely caused by an actual 
## causal influence, instead being plausibly caused just by chance. Therefore, from
## now on we drop Net trade as a factor in our analysis. 

## Task 2:

formula_C <- gdp_growth ~ gdp_pc_ppp + unemployment_total +
  age_dependency + I(unemployment_total^2) + urban_pct +
  life_expectancy_female + population_growth+ tax_payments

model_C <- lm(formula_C, data = model_df_linear, singular.ok = FALSE)
summary(model_C)

### Adj. R sqr = 0.03226 
## Higher R¬≤ when adding a squared factor for unemployment, and the unemployment variable
## is significant in both the unemployment and unemployment¬≤. Therefore, including
## the polynomial results in better fit and should be included. However, before interpreting
## the coefficients, we run OLS diagnostics to compare both models in this regard.

## model diagnostics model A (without polynomial term and trade)
plot(model_A)
## does not seem to be non-linearity and heteroskedasticity in residual plot, but there 
## is an outlier in fitted values and qqplot graphs. Also, qq-plot slight deviations 
## around the tails but for the rest fitted quite nicely on teh line. 
## no high residual in high-leverage point --> flat line in residuals vs leverage
vif(model_A)
## no multicollinearity

## model diagnostics model 2
plot(model_C)
## plots look the same for the model in question 2 than in question 3 --> do not seem to have
## a problem with non-linearity and heteroskedasticity, there is an outlier. qq-plot 
## slight deviations around the tails but for the rest fitted quite nicely on teh line. 
## no high residual in high-leverage point --> flat line in residuals vs leverage
vif(model_C)
## multicollinearity between unemployment and unemployment squared, as expected. 
## This is not necessarily an issue, since they are both of the same variable, and
## can be used for model prediction. However, independent interpretation of both 
## seperate from one another is not ideal.

## the model diagnostics do not significantly change when including the polynomial,
## and look decent either way. 

## Task 3: Now run a penalized regression using LASSO to check if the model works. Do not 
## mind adjustments at this stage, just run the model with the same variables as the 
## regression you ran in the question before. Does the model work? Explain what is the 
## difference in comparison to 2.

cvfit <- cv.glmnet(x=X, y=y, alpha=1, type.measure = "mse", nfolds = 10)
print(cvfit)

plot(cvfit)

coef(cvfit, s = "lambda.min")
coef(cvfit, s = "lambda.1se")

## the LASSO deleted most variables in the minimal lambda (lambda=0.2740), meaning that 
## the LASSO worked. With the lambda using 1 standard deviation away, all coefficients 
## are even deleted. 
## The difference between the LASSO and the model in question 2 is that
## LASSO penalizes the use of variables. Thereby, LASSO shrinks the coefficients with
## a penalization. Subsequently, it minimizes the sum of the residual sum of squares
## and the penalty, which means that the variables that decrease are the ones that 
## are actually important in predicting GDP growth. LASSO subsequently takes out
## variables that have a coefficient of 0. In our case, this happened with most variables,
## indicating that the variables do not perform well in predicting GDP growth.
## Now, the only variables that remained in the model were those of GDP per capita
## and Unemployment for the minimal lambda. The coefficients in the LASSO regression 
## were smaller than those for the linear regression, which makes sense, as LASSO 
## decreases coefficient size.

## Task 4: Why is it important to standardize predictors before applying penalized 
## regression? Demonstrate with one example from your dataset.

## It is important to standardize predictors before applying penalized regression, 
## because LASSO penalizes variables on their coefficient size. When predictors are
## not standardized beforehand, this means that the different variables get "judged"
## differently based on their scale, with a variable measured in cents being judged
## 100 times as much as a variable measured in dollars, or a variable in year-on-year
## change different than one showing total rates.

cvfit1 <- cv.glmnet(x=X, y=y, alpha=1, type.measure = "mse", nfolds = 10, standardize=TRUE)

cvfit2 <- cv.glmnet(x=X, y=y, alpha=1, type.measure = "mse", nfolds = 10, standardize=FALSE)
plot(cvfit2$glmnet.fit, xvar = "lambda", label = TRUE)

# Coefficeints of both models
coef(cvfit2, s = "lambda.min")
coef(cvfit1, s = "lambda.min")


## Rationale: Without standardization, variables measured in large numbers (like dollars) get punished more 
## heavily than those in percentages, not because they‚Äôre less important, but just because of their units. 
## Standardizing puts everything on the same scale so the algorithm can judge importance fairly.

## Task 5: After you show the results with LASSO, your manager is convinced that 
## penalized regression is the way to go. Hence, she asks you to construct two 
## additional penalized regression models to predict GDP growth (annual %).
## even teams work with ridge regression and elastic net --> next couple of questions

## Task 7: For the training sample, run both methods, while choosing the optimal penalty 
## parameter through crossvalidation (for elastic net, you should optimize both Œ± and Œª). 
## Report the final model for both methods (you can put the table in the appendix of the
## report). Give an interpretation, including which variables are more relevant for predicting 
## GPD growth, and point out similarities and differences between the two models that 
## you consider relevant.

## interpretation -> Francesco and Michael

## Task 9: Discuss why choosing Œª purely based on minimizing cross-validation error 
## may sometimes lead to overfitting. What is the role of the ‚Äú1-SE rule‚Äù in mitigating
## this risk?

## Choosing Œª purely based on minimizing cross-validation error may lead to overfitting,
## because the Ridge/elastic net models estimate lambda using solely the training data. 
## therefore, it might bias the estimators to such an extent that it predicts the outcome
## in the training dataset with great accuracy, but performs less well in predicting
## "new" outcomes in the testing dataset through overfitting. Therefore, the 1-SE rule
## can mitigate this risk, as it penalizes the coefficients further, which mean further
## shrinking of the coefficients, which are therefore less biased in order to fit the 
## training data too perfectly, leading to less overfitting. Therefore, it is good 
## practice to test both the ideal lambda and the lambda using the "1-SE rule"

## Task 14: INTERPRETATION --> MICHAEL AND FRANCESCO

##... which model is the best? 
## If you could acquire more data, would you prefer having more variables (columns), 
## or more countries available (more rows). Why?: ....
